```

Install the project:
```bash
sudo python setup.py install

### Method 3 - Developer install using Virtualenv

Install the `python-virtualenv` package:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalliope-project/kalliope.git
cd kalliope
```

Generate a local python environment:

cd kalliope
```

Install the python dependencies directly:
```bash

```

## Test your env

To ensure that you can record your voice, run the following command to capture audio input from your microphone:
```bash
rec test.wav
```

Press CTRL-C after capturing a sample of your voice.

Then play the recorded audio file
```bash
mplayer test.wav
```

You can then test that your Kalliope is working by using the "bonjour" order integrated in the [default brain](../kalliope/brain.yml).
Start kalliope:
```bash
kalliope start
```

> **Note:** Do not start Kalliope as root user or with sudo

Kalliope will load default settings and brain, the output should looks the following
```bash
Starting event manager
Events loaded
Starting Kalliope
Press Ctrl+C for stopping
Starting REST API Listening port: 5000
```

Then speak the hotwork out loud to wake up Kalliope. By default, the hotwork is "Kalliop√©" with the french pronunciation.
If the trigger is successfully raised, you'll see "say something" into the console. 
```bash
2016-12-05 20:54:21,950 :: INFO :: Keyword 1 detected at time: 2016-12-05 20:54:21
Say something!
```

Then you can say "bonjour" and listen the Kalliope response.
```bash
Say something!
Google Speech Recognition thinks you said Bonjour
Order matched in the brain. Running synapse "say-hello-fr"
Waiting for trigger detection
```
